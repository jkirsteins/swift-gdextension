/// A single texture resource which consists of multiple, separate images. Each image has the same dimensions and number of mipmap levels.
/// 
/// A Texture2DArray is different from a Texture3D: The Texture2DArray does not support trilinear interpolation between the [Image]s, i.e. no blending. See also [Cubemap] and [CubemapArray], which are texture arrays with specialized cubemap functions.
///  
/// A Texture2DArray is also different from an [AtlasTexture]: In a Texture2DArray, all images are treated separately. In an atlas, the regions (i.e. the single images) can be of different sizes. Furthermore, you usually need to add a padding around the regions, to prevent accidental UV mapping to more than one region. The same goes for mipmapping: Mipmap chains are handled separately for each layer. In an atlas, the slicing has to be done manually in the fragment shader.
///  
/// To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets.
